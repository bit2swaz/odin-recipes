    <p>This lasagna recipe takes a little work, but it is <b>SO</b> satisfying and filling that it's worth it!</p>

    <ul class="ingre-list">
        <li><strong>Meat</strong> - This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
        <li><strong>Onion and Garlic</strong> - An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Tomato Products</strong> - You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar</strong> - Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices and Seasonings</strong> - This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Lasagna Noodles</strong> - Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheeses</strong> - Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg</strong> - An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
    </ul>
