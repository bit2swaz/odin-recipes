The Odin Project: Foundations Course - HTML Foundations Recipes Project

This is a simple multi-page website built using HTML as part of The Odin Project’s Foundations curriculum.

It includes:
- Internal page linking using relative paths
- Semantic HTML basics (headings, lists, images, etc.)
- Organized folder and file structure
- Daily commits for version tracking

What I’ll improve in the future:
- Add internal CSS once I learn it
- Improve layout and readability using semantic containers like `<section>` and `<main>`
- Improve mobile responsiveness later in the curriculum

Built with pure HTML. No frameworks. No templates. Just raw code and discipline.

This is Day 3 of 1461. Another brick laid in the foundation. Another day, another W.
