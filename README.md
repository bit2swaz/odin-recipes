The Odin Project: Foundations Course - HTML Foundations Recipes Project

This project is a part of the HTML Foundations section of The Odin Project. The goal is to create a basic website consisting of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes using only HTML. No CSS is used in this stage â€” the focus is purely on understanding and applying semantic HTML to structure content effectively.

By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated:

- Proper use of semantic HTML elements (html, head, body, img, etc.)

- Logical content hierarchy using headings and paragraphs

- Embedding images and links into a structured layout

- Writing clean, readable, and maintainable HTML code

This project lays the groundwork for learning how to pair structure with style as we move forward into CSS.

This is Day 3 of 1461. Another brick laid in the foundation. Another day, another W.
